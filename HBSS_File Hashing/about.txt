#     The purpose of this application is to hash known binaries used by Motorola   #
#   Solutions, Inc. and third party applications.  The user selects predefined     #
#   inventories lists that are stored within the ..\Data\ directory.  Each entry   #
#   within the 'astroInventory.txt' will be used to populate the combobox.  The    #
#   'astroInventory.txt' is stored within the ..\Scripts\ directory.               #
#                                                                                  #

Application File Structure

..\Data\{client name}_values.txt  =   Stores the directories that need to be hashed based on the client selection
..\Data\astroInventory.txt        =   Stores all Astro Client names used to populate combobox selection
..\Scripts\astroInventory.ps1     =   The main application

AstroInventory.txt File Struction:

This file is a simple text file that stores the names of all the Astro Client names.
The application is looking for this file.  In the event this file is not found, the
user will need to utilize the 'Custom...' combobox selection.  This will allow the user
to use the application even without a predefined inventory list.  Within the example 
below, the '#' is used to add comments within the .txt files imported into the application.
These lines will be omitted when the application pulls from the .txt file.

Astro DC_values.txt

The file names for each client are important.  The [client name] must match within the
AstroInventory.txt and [client name]_values.txt.  The application populates the combobox
selections from the AstroInventory.txt as shown in Figure 1.  The application uses that 
[client name] to then look at the \Data\ path to pull in the directories that need to be
hashed.  The directories are also housed within a .txt file.
